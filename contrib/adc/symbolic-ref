# allow 'git symbolic-ref' over a gitolite connection

# replaces and obsoletes the 'set-head' ADC, which was too specific

# Security: remember all arguments to ADCs must match a very conservative
# pattern; see doc/admin-defined-commands.mkd.  Once that is assured, the
# symbolic-ref command has no security related side-effects, so we don't check
# arguments at all -- we just pass them on.

# Note: because of the restriction on allowed characters in arguments, you
# can't supply an arbitrary string to the '-m' option.  The simplest
# work-around is-to-just-use-join-up-words-like-this if you feel the need to
# supply a "reason" string.  In any case this is useless by default; you'd
# have to have core.logAllRefUpdates set for it to have any meaning.
