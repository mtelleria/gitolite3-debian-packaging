# F=ldap_helpers ldap helper programs

These programs were contributed by the Nokia MeeGo folks.

The first 2 are perl and shell verisions of programs meant to be used as
`$GL_GET_MEMBERSHIPS_PGM` (see [this][ldap] for more).

  * ldap-query-example.pl
  * ldap-query-example.sh

The third program is meant to be installed as an adc (admin-defined command,
see [here][ADCs]), and helps users change their LDAP passwords.

  * passwd

Enjoy!
