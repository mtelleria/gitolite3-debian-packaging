Go to http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html#contact for information on
contacting me, the mailing list, and IRC channel.  *Unless you are reporting
what you think is a security issue, I prefer you send to the mailing list,
not to me directly.*

Please DO NOT send messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin
comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+, and any other Web 3.0
"coolness". (The issues system does have an email interface, but it is not a
substitute for email. I can't cc anyone else when I want to, for instance.
Well I can, but any response the original requester then makes using the
website will not get cc-d to the person I cc-d).

Please send patches *via email*, not as github pull requests. Again, if you
think it's a security issue, send it directly to my gmail address, but
otherwise please send it to the mailing list, so others can see it and comment
on it.

The preferred format is the files created by git-format-patch, as attachments.
However, if your repo has a public clone URL, you can make a new branch just
for this fix, and send the repo URL and branch name to the mailing list.

(If you do send me a github pull request, I may take it if it's a trivial
patch, but otherwise I'll ask you to close the pull request, then read
this URL for how to send me the patch.)
