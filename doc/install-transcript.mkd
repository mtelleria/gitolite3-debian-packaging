### about this document

This is a *complete* transcript of a full gitolite install, *from scratch*,
using brand new userids ("sita" on the client, "git" on the server).  Please
note that you can use existing userids also, it is not necessary to use
dedicated user IDs for this.  In particular, people who have a single user
hosting account can also use this method, as long as they have password access
as a fallback if they screw up the keys somewhere.  Also, you don't have to
use some *other* server for all this, both server and client can be
"localhost" if you like.

Please note that this entire transcript can be summarised as:

  * create users on client and server (optional)
  * get pubkey access to server from client (`ssh-copy-id` or manual eqvt)
  * run one command ***on client*** (`gl-easy-install`)

...and only that last step is actually gitolite.  In fact, the bulk of the
transcript is **non**-gitolite stuff :)

**Please also note that this method will setup everything on the server, but
you have to run it on your workstation, NOT on the server!**

### create userids on server and client (optional)

Client side: add user, give him a password

    sita-lt:~ # useradd sita

    sita-lt:~ # passwd sita
    Changing password for user sita.
    New UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

Server side: (log on to server, then) add user, give it a password

    sita-lt:~ # ssh sitaram@server
    sitaram@server's password:
    Last login: Fri Dec 18 20:25:06 2009
    -bash-3.2$ su -
    Password:

    sita-sv:~ # useradd git

    sita-sv:~ # passwd git
    Changing password for user git.
    New UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

Server side: allow ssh access to "git" user

This is done by editing the sshd config file and adding "git" to the
"AllowUsers" list (the grep command is just confirming the change we made,
because I'm not showing the actual "vi" session):

    sita-sv:~ # vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    sita-sv:~ # grep -i allowusers /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    AllowUsers sitaram git

    sita-sv:~ # service sshd restart
    Stopping sshd:                                                  [  OK  ]
    Starting sshd:                                                  [  OK  ]

**NOTE**: if the `AllowUsers` setting is completely missing from the sshd
config file, all users are allowed (see `man sshd_config`).  You may prefer to
leave it that way -- your choice.  I prefer to make the usernames explicit
because I'm paranoid ;-)

<a name="_get_pubkey_access_from_client_to_server"></a>

### get pubkey access from client to server

This involves creating a keypair for yourself (using `ssh-keygen`), and
copying the public part of that keypair to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
on the server (using `ssh-copy-id`, if you're on Linux, or the manual method
described in the `ssh-copy-id` section in `doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd`).

    sita-lt:~ $ su - sita
    Password:

    sita@sita-lt:~ $ ssh-keygen
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/sita/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Created directory '/home/sita/.ssh'.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/sita/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/sita/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    8a:e0:60:1b:04:58:68:50:a4:d7:d0:3a:a5:2d:bf:0a sita@sita-lt.atc.tcs.com
    The key's randomart image is:

    sita@sita-lt:~ $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub git@server
    git@server's password:
    /usr/bin/xauth:  creating new authority file /home/git/.Xauthority
    Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'git@server'", and check in:

      .ssh/authorized_keys

    to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

Double check to make sure you can log on to `git@server` without a password:

    sita@sita-lt:~ $ ssh git@server pwd
    /home/git

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS WORKS OK!**

### install gitolite

Note that gitolite is installed from the *client*.  The `easy-install` script
runs on the client but installs gitolite on the server!

    sita@sita-lt:~ $ cd gitolite-source/src

<font color="red"> **This is the only gitolite specific command in a typical
install sequence**.  </font> Run it without any arguments to see a usage
message.  Run it without the `-q` to get a more verbose, pause-at-every-step,
install mode that allows you to change the defaults (for example, if you want
a different UMASK setting, or you want the repos to be in a different place,
etc.)

    sita@sita-lt:src $ ./gl-easy-install -q git server sitaram

    Reminder:
        *Your* URL for cloning any repo on this server will be

        *Other* users you set up will have to use

        If this is your first time installing gitolite, please also:
            tail -31 ./gl-easy-install
        for next steps.

<a name="_VERY_IMPORTANT_"></a>

### VERY IMPORTANT...

Please read the text that the easy-install command produces as output when you
run it.  People who fail to read this get into trouble later.  And I didn't
write all that because I wanted to practice typing.

The text just above this section is an approximation; your version will
contain the correct URLs for your install, including port numbers if
non-standard ports were used).

Try out that `tail -31 ./gl-easy-install` too :)

<a name="_examine_what_you_have"></a>

### examine what you have

The last step of the previous command creates a local clone of your
gitolite-admin repo in `~/gitolite-admin`.

    sita@sita-lt:src $ cd ~/gitolite-admin/

    sita@sita-lt:gitolite-admin $ git --no-pager log --stat
    commit 2f40d4bb80d424dc39aae5d0973f8c1b2e395666
    Author: git <git@sita-lt.atc.tcs.com>
    Date:   Thu Dec 24 21:39:15 2009 +0530

        start

     conf/gitolite.conf |   12 ++++++++++++
     keydir/sitaram.pub |    1 +
     2 files changed, 13 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

And that's really all.  Add keys to keydir here, edit conf/gitolite.conf as
needed, then add, commit, and push the changes to the server.

<a name="_emergency_password_access"></a>

### emergency password access

If you lose your keys or the worst happens and you use the wrong key for the
wrong thing and apparently lose all access, but you still know the password,
this is what you do:

    sita@sita-lt:~ $ ssh -o preferredauthentications=password git@server
    git@server's password:
