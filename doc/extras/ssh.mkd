# ssh

There are two documents you need to read, in order:

  * [Gitolite and ssh][glssh] explains how gitolite uses openssh features to
    create any number of virtual users over just one actual (unix) user, and
    distinguish between them by their public keys.

  * [Ssh troubleshooting][sts] is a rather long document that, as far as I
    know, covers almost every known ssh related issue.  If you find something
    missing, send me an email with details so I can update it.
