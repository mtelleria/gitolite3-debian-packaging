## #writable disabling pushes to take backups

The `writable` command allows you to disable pushes to all repos or just the
named repo, in order to do file-system level things to the repo directory that
require it not to change, like using normal backup software.

Run `gitolite writable -h` for more info.

## #pers "personal" branches

"personal" branches are great for environments where developers need to share
work but can't directly pull from each other (usually due to either a
networking or authentication related reason, both common in corporate setups).

Personal branches exist **in a namespace** of their own.  The syntax is

        RW+ personal/USER/  =   @userlist

where the "personal" can be anything you like (but cannot be empty), and the
"/USER/" part is **necessary (including both slashes)**.

A user "alice" (if she's in the userlist) can then push any branches inside
`personal/alice/`.  Which means she can push `personal/alice/foo` and
`personal/alice/bar`, but NOT `personal/alice`.

(Background: at runtime the "USER" component will be replaced by the name of
the invoking user.  Access is determined by the right hand side, as usual).

Compared to using arbitrary branch names on the same server, this:

  * Reduces namespace pollution by corralling all these ad hoc branches into
    the "personal/" namespace.
  * Reduces branch name collision by giving each developer her own
    sub-hierarchy within that.
  * Removes the need to think about access control, because a user can push
    only to his own sub-hierarchy.
