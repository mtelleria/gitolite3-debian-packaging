# gitolite administration

## #server server-side administration

The following activities require command line access to the server:

  * Changing anything in the [rc][] file.
  * Installing custom [hooks][], whether to all repos or just some repos.
  * Moving [existing][] repos into gitolite control.

Please read the [WARNINGS][] page first.

## #conf access control (the gitolite.conf file)

Most of gitolite's power is in the conf/gitolite.conf file, which specifies
detailed access control for repos.

### #confex example of a conf file

Here is an example of a simple conf/gitolite.conf file.

        @staff              =   dilbert alice           # line 1
        @projects           =   foo bar                 # line 2

        repo @projects baz                              # line 3
            RW+             =   @staff                  # line 4
            -       master  =   ashok                   # line 5
            RW              =   ashok                   # line 6
            R               =   wally                   # line 7

            config hooks.emailprefix = '[%GL_REPO] '    # line 8
