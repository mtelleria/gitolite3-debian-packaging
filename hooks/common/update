# this is gitolite's update hook

# how run:      via git, being copied as .git/hooks/update in every repo
# when:         every push
# input:
#     - see man githooks for STDIN
#     - uses the compiled config file to get permissions info
# output:       based on permissions etc., exit 0 or 1
# security:
#     - none

# robustness:
