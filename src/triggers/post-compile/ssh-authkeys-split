#!/bin/bash

#   split multi-key files into separate keys like ssh-authkeys likes

# WHY
# ---
#
# Yeah I wonder that too, when it's so much more maintainable to keep the damn
# keys as sitaram@home.pub and sitaram@work.pub or such.  But there's no
# accounting for tastes, and some old fogies apparently want to put all of a
# user's keys into a single ".pub" file.

# WARNINGS AND CAVEATS
# --------------------
#
# - assumes no "@" sign in basenames of any multi-key files (single line file
#   may still have them)
# - assumes you don't have a subdir in keydir called "__split_keys__"
# - God help you if you try to throw in a putty key in there.

# SUPPORT
# -------
#
# NONE.  Mainly because I **know** someone will throw in a putty key.  I just
# know it.

# USAGE
# -----
#
# to enable, uncomment the 'ssh-authkeys-split' line in the ENABLE list in the
# rc file.

cd $GL_ADMIN_BASE/keydir

rm -rf __split_keys__
mkdir __split_keys__
export SKD=$PWD/__split_keys__

find . -type f -name "*.pub" | while read k
do
    # do we need to split?
    lines=`wc -l < $k`
    [ "$lines" = "1" ] && continue

    # is it sane to split?
    base=`basename $k .pub`
    echo $base | grep '@' >/dev/null && continue

    # ok do it
    seq=1
    while read line
    do
        echo "$line" > $SKD/$base@$seq.pub
        (( seq++ ))
    done < $k

    # now delete the original file
    rm $k
done
