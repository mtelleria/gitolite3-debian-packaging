# A bit of explanation may be in order.  The gitolite output looks somewhat
# like this:

#   bar^Idaemon^IR any bar daemon DENIED by fallthru$
#   foo^Idaemon^Irefs/.*$
#   fubar^Idaemon^Irefs/.*$
#   gitolite-admin^Idaemon^IR any gitolite-admin daemon DENIED by fallthru$
#   testing^Idaemon^Irefs/.*$

# where I've type "^I" to denote a tab.

# Shell has to fork 'rm' to delete a file but perl doesn't.  So removing the
# export-ok file from repos where needed is done in perl.

# On the other hand, perls requires a bit more *code* to even create an empty
# file.  Shell can do it with just "> file", and it doesn't fork for this.  So
# that part is handled in shell.

# You'll also see that the perl part is taking what it needs from the input
# and passing the rest on, so the shell part doesn't have to do any grepping,
# which would be a horrible slowdown.

# $F and the rest is the magic of perl's flags (man perlrun).
