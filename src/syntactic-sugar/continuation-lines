# vim: syn=perl:

# "sugar script" (syntactic sugar helper) for gitolite3

# Enabling this script in the rc file allows you to use back-slash escaped
# continuation lines, like in C or shell etc.

# This script also serves as an example "sugar script" if you want to write
# your own (and maybe send them to me).  A "sugar script" in gitolite will be
# executed via a perl 'do' and is expected to contain one function called
# 'sugar_script'.  This function should take a listref and return a listref.
# Each item in the list is one line.  There are NO newlines; g3 kills them off
# fairly early in the process.

# If you're not familiar with perl please do not try this.  Ask me to write
# you a sugar script instead.

sub sugar_script {
    my $lines = shift;

    my @out  = ();
    my $keep = '';
    for my $l (@$lines) {
        if ( $l =~ s/\\$// ) {
            $keep .= $l;
        } else {
            $l = $keep . $l if $keep;
            $keep = '';
            push @out, $l;
        }
