Description: SSH-based gatekeeper for git repositories version 3
 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that
 hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite,
 each developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would need a
 user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just using
 SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts all the
 repositories.
 .
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
 (push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an
 important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:
   * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
   * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
   * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
   * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
   * easy integration with gitweb;
   * comprehensive logging;
   * easy migration from gitosis.
 .
 WARNING:  If you come from version 2 of gitolite, beware that this
 package contains the version 3 which has been written from scratch
 and contains significant differences in the format and internal
 working.  We strongly suggest to read the recent documentation at 
 http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html to get familiarized 
 with the new design principles.
 .
 This package can coexist with and won't affect existing gitolite2
 installations, however if you plan to migrate those repositories to
 g3, please be sure to read first the migration notes at 
 http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/install.html#migr
