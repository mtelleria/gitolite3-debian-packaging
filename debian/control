Description: SSH-based gatekeeper for git repositories
 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that
 hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite,
 each developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would need a
 user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just using
 SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts all the
 repositories.
 .
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
 (push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an
 important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:
   * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
   * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
   * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
   * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
   * easy integration with gitweb;
   * comprehensive logging;
   * easy migration from gitosis.
